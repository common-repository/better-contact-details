Maintain contact details - even when you switch themes

== Description ==

Better Contact Details adds settings for all your different contact details, such as phone numbers, email address and postal address as well as links to your accounts on all the major social media services, like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and so on.

The plugin supports the Customizer so you can update details live via the Customizer or through the settings page. You can add contact details to your theme via shortcode or widget.

= Why do I need this? =

The purpose behind this plugin is to allow you to maintain contact information across themes. Many themes store contact data as theme options, which don't persist when you switch themes. This plugin gets round the problem and, as such, is ideal for theme developers to include in their themes. However, because of its simple-to-use widget and shortcode, it will work in any theme.

= What else do I need to know? =

* The plugin is extendable so if you don't find the social media account or other contact detail you need, you can easily add it.
* You can opt to display icons against each contact item or use labels.
* You can edit the labels in the settings if you wish.
* You can update via the Customizer or the settings page.
